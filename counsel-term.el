;;; Commentary:

;; Some hacky but extremely convenient functions for making life inside
;; term-mode easier.  All of them make use of two things: first, the excellent
;; 'ivy-read' API and second, the fact that you can send raw control characters
;; such representing C-k, C-u, etc to your terminal using
;; 'term-send-raw-string'.
;;
;; A summary:

;; counsel-term-history -- A simple utility that completing-reads your
;; ~/.bash_history (or whatever other file you want, really) and sends the
;; selected candidate to the terminal.  To get going, bind 'counsel-term-history
;; to some nice stroke in your term-mode-map, C-r comes quite naturally to
;; mind.

;; counsel-term-cd -- Recursively find a directory, starting at $PWD, and cd to
;; it.

;; counsel-term-ff -- Find file with completion in current dir.  If it's a
;; directory, cd to it and call counsel-term-ff again.  If not, open it using
;; find-file.  The recursion is really badly implemented ATM using elisp sleep
;; which results in a flickering minibuffer.  Advice appreciated :
;; Note: This package has no association with counsel or ivy apart from using
;; the ivy api and kinda feeling lika a counsel package.  The author admits to
;; a slighy fanboy-ism towards their creator however -- support him on Patreon!
;; More instructions on his site, oremacs.com.
